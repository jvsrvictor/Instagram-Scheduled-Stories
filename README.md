Instagram doesn't have a feature to schedule Stories natively through Creators Studio,
and there is no free tool on the market to do it.

So I implemented a simple script that uploads a Story (Video one) to your profile using
the Instagrapi unoficial API. By itself, it is not a scheduled post, but with a simple
Crontab on a remote server (Even in the free ones like Pythonanywhere.com) it can post
your Story automaticaly.

It's the only known free way to schedule a Instagram Story.
